defmodule Registro.Authorization do
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides a unified way to handle authorizaton errors,
  as well as a conveniente plug for hooking authorization tests into
  controller actions.

  The plug is configured with check functions that receive the connection and
  the current user and return one of the following:

    - true, which means the request is authorized
    - {true, abilities}, which means the request is authorized and
      the user is allowed the specified abilities on the accessed resource
    - any other result means the request is not authorized

  Example usage:
  ```
  plug Registro.Authorization, check: &MyController.authorize_request/2
  ```

  To handle authorization errors without using the plug, use the
  handle_unauthorized/1 function.
